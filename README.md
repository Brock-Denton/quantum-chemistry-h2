# Quantum Chemistry: H₂ Ground State Energy Visualization

This project calculates and visualizes the ground state energy of the H₂ molecule as a function of bond length using the Hartree-Fock method with PySCF.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook hartree_fock_h2.ipynb
